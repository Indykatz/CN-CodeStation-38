# Team 2's Final Project

## This final project's outlines were:

## Front-End:

> 1. React & CSS

    - The Front-End will use React and CSS to create a UX/UI for the user

> 2. Create/Login user functionality

    - The user should be able to use a login or create a
    login to access the application

> 3. Additional funtionality

    - The theme of the application doesn't necessarily need to
    interact with the REST API or a Database Layer

> 4. Hosted on Netlify

## Back-End:

> 1. Node & Express

    - The Back-End will use Node and express to create the database
     and functionality for Front-End integration

> 2. CREATE & READ

    - Handle CREATE and READ for a user model
    (create user, login user)

> 3. Database

    - Work with a DB Layer (MongoDB/MySQL)

> 4. Hosted on Heroku

## Optional/Stretch goals

> 1. UPDATE & DELETE

    - UPDATE and DELETE for user in both REST API and React app

> 2. Bcrypt hashing

    - Use Bcrypt hashing for passwords in the Back-End

> 3. JWT

    - Use JSON Web Token for persistent log in

> 4. CRUD with DB via REST API

    - Additional app functionality has full CRUD with DB layer via REST API

> 5. 3rd Party API integration

# Project Concept

## Code Station

> - A coding content site (using a 3rd party API to pull the data from and lists them[^1])
> - Login to account
> - show interest in coding contents
> - Users can see more details for events and add it to a list of events they plan to attend
> - Connect to other users

###### Planning [^2]

# A word from some of our team :student:[^3]

###### What was your fav lecture and why?

> All lectures were enjoyable and new to me which has helped me grasp certain
> technical terminologies. Probably my favourite lecture is react because its very
> interesting. - Abdel

###### What was your fav lecture and why?

> Andy's lecture on react filled in all this missing pieces of information I had over
> react, but my favourite was Andy's lecture on the REST API, I had been working on it the
> evening prior and Andy had all the answers to my questions. - Kat

###### What did you struggle with?

> Probably initially with problem solving especially during the clone website task
> as it forced me to dig deep into how to tackle the problem and clone the site as
> it should be. - Abdel

###### What did you find easiest?

> Anything to do with Animations, CSS and creative works. sign me up! - John

###### What is one thing you learned from working as a team on your final project?

> Using Miro to communicate more effectively with a group of people about
> design. I will be using in the future with clients. - Dom

###### If you could change anything within the course, what and why?

> If I could change anything, it most likely would be the length of time to learn
> React, it was what a lot of us struggled on, but we also learned a lot from our mistakes.
> Throughout this project, we turned our Ls into Learning and turned conflict into
> communication and that was the most important aspect in this course. - Wren

###### Where do you see yourself post-course :mortar_board: (completely optional)?

> Hopefully a job. Would like to try and brush up further my web dev skills, look
> towards tools for game dev and find an opportunity to learn with a company\* - Dom
>
> I am hopeful for the opportunity with Grayce for the Tech + programme as it would
> be a live changing for me, however I would also like to grow as a instructor both as
> a volunteer for Wirral Code Club and CoderDojo but also for amazing company like Code Nation.
> I feel I have so many options after this course and this is the start of my life.
> Who said life couldn't begin at 40 - Kat
>
> see myself working in the industry so applying for now is key once I land the job
> then improving on the skills I gained during the 3 month bootcamp is a must. - Abdel
>
> Freelance work in Web Development so I can become and call myself an Expert in React,
> Tailwind, JavaScript and Next.js - John
>
> I hope to enjoy the summer holidays with my daughter, celebrate her 3rd birthday before
> her first day at school and then join the next cohort for Cyber at CodeNation. - Wren

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
